# Introduction

A simple character controller using Finite State Machines design pattern, for practice.

The character as well as the animations were all taken from Mixamo...and may not look quite good, but my purpose was to just practice FSM, so meh!

# Controls
- WSAD:               Move
- Space:              Jump
- Ctrl:               Crouch
- LMB:                Strike
- LMB Thrice Quickly: Special Strike
- RMB:                        Defend

# Mechanisms
A basic controller with movement, jump, crouch, attack and defence mechanisms. 

Fighting mode changes how the player moves a little bit. If you play some big games like Witcher or Assassin's Creed, you will see that in normal mode, if you press A or Left, the character turns 90 degrees in that direction and moves along that axis. But when fighting, this changes to the character strafing rather than turning around. This is to sort of "keep an eye" on the enemy target. This is reflected in this sample too.
